# Workshop: Thinking in Sandboxes

This workshop introduces Sandboxes as a general computing primitive and uses Cloudflare Sandboxes as the concrete implementation. Participants explore common, real-world use cases for sandboxed execution and learn how to reason about when and why sandboxes are the right tool.

The workshop is intentionally product-adjacent rather than product-specific. Cloudflare Sandboxes are used throughout, but the concepts apply broadly to modern secure execution environments.

## Workshop Goals

By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to:

- Explain what a sandbox is and why it exists as a compute primitive
- Identify common problems that sandboxes are well suited to solve
- Safely execute untrusted or dynamic code
- Use sandboxes for development, testing, and automation workflows
- Reason about security, performance, and tradeoffs when choosing sandboxed execution

## What Is a Sandbox

A sandbox is an isolated execution environment designed to safely run code that cannot be fully trusted ahead of time. In this workshop, Cloudflare Sandboxes provide:

- A secure, container-based execution environment
- The ability to run shell commands and scripts
- File system access scoped to the sandbox
- Support for languages like Node.js and Python
- Optional preview URLs for HTTP services
- Real-time access to logs and output
- Controlled lifecycle management

Sandboxes make it possible to execute dynamic code without exposing the host system or long-lived infrastructure to risk.

## Core Use Cases Covered in the Workshop

### 1. AI-Generated Code Execution

Sandboxes are used to safely execute code generated by AI systems.

Participants explore how an application can:

- Accept code generated by a model
- Execute it inside a sandbox
- Capture output, logs, and errors
- Return results to a user or agent

This pattern is foundational for AI assistants, autonomous agents, and tools that need to validate or run model-produced code.

Example exercise:
- Generate a Python script that transforms input data
- Execute the script in a sandbox
- Inspect the output and error handling

---

### 2. Data Analysis and Notebook-Style Workflows

Sandboxes function as lightweight, ephemeral data analysis environments.

Participants use sandboxes to:

- Load CSV or JSON data files
- Perform analysis with Python libraries
- Produce summaries or derived outputs

This mirrors notebook-style workflows without requiring persistent servers or local setup.

Example exercise:
- Upload a dataset
- Analyze it with Python
- Output a summary or computed result

---

### 3. Interactive Development Environments

Sandboxes can host short-lived development environments.

Participants explore how to:

- Clone a Git repository into a sandbox
- Run a development server
- Expose the server via a preview URL
- Make changes and observe live updates

This demonstrates how sandboxes can power interactive demos, previews, and cloud-based development tools.

Example exercise:
- Clone a small web app
- Run it inside a sandbox
- Access it through a preview URL

---

### 4. CI, Testing, and Build Pipelines

Sandboxes provide isolated environments for builds and tests.

Participants learn how to:

- Run test suites in isolation
- Execute build steps without persistent runners
- Stream logs in real time

This pattern applies to CI systems, preview builds, and automated verification workflows.

Example exercise:
- Run a test command for a JavaScript project
- Capture and analyze the output
- Discuss failure isolation and cleanup

---

### 5. Security and Untrusted Code Execution

Sandboxes shine when code cannot be trusted.

Participants examine scenarios where:

- User-submitted code must be executed
- Security boundaries are critical
- The host system must remain protected

This section focuses on isolation guarantees, lifecycle management, and blast-radius reduction.

Example exercise:
- Execute intentionally malformed or unsafe code
- Observe how the sandbox contains the behavior

---

Hands-on:
- Launch and access a preview application

---

### Session 5: Automation and CI Patterns

- Using sandboxes for builds and tests
- Streaming logs
- Cleaning up environments

Hands-on:
- Run a build or test workflow

---

## Key Concepts and APIs Discussed

- Ephemeral versus persistent sandboxes
- Executing shell commands
- File system access and isolation
- Preview URLs for services
- Lifecycle management and cleanup
- Streaming output and logs

## Discussion and Wrap-Up

The workshop closes with a group discussion covering:

- When sandboxes are the right abstraction
- Security implications and trust boundaries
- Performance considerations
- Cost and operational tradeoffs
- Real-world applications such as AI agents, CI systems, and interactive tools

Participants leave with a mental model for thinking in sandboxes and a practical understanding of how Cloudflare Sandboxes fit into modern application architectures.
